    This project aims to develop skills in developing client-side (front-end) web and mobile applications.
The project has a mobile application and website for exercise and healthy meals aimed at people who can't go to a gym or get dietary advice by other means.
The goal of the app is for the user to have easy access to workout plans that match their goal (whether gaining mass or losing weight) as well as easy monitoring of their daily progress.
In addition to the workout plans, the application also suggests healthy recipes that can help the user reach his or her goal.
The web application was implemented using web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the mobile application was implemented using Java and developed in the IDE Android Studio.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

 <img src="images/BodyBoostIcon.png" alt="Logo" width="160" height="160">

The project is an exercise app that suggests training plans and eating plans to users accor-
ding to their goals (Gain mass or lose weight). The intention of the app is to give the user
easy access to workout plans as well as healthy meals that help them reach their goal. The
app also features a progress bar that makes it easy for the user to track their daily progress.
The application is intended for users who do not have access to gyms or nutritionists. To
develop this application we chose the "Java" programming languages since it was the one that was taugh and it is
widely used for developing mobile devices. Keep in mind that this project was developed in an education environment. 
<br>
<br>
<Strong>The training plans and dietary advice were formed based on research on some websites and other applications on the market. We are not experts in the field and we strongly advise that if you want to get both dietary advice and a well-structured training plan that you contact experts.</Strong>
