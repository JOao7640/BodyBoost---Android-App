                development. We are in the final year of our course, and this year, we will have the opportunity to
                put into practice the lessons we have learned in the areas of web and Android development. This
                semester, we will be focusing on backend development and API creation. </p>

        <p class="mt-5 text-lg text-justify">
            Bodyboost is a project that has emerged from a strong desire to assist individuals who, due to economic
            or geographical constraints, find it challenging to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Our goal is to create
            an application that empowers users to pursue their aspirations for a healthier life. This app will
            provide them with access to a wealth of resources, including recipes, personalized workout plans, and
            the latest sports news.</p>
