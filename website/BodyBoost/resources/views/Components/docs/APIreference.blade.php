                            The BodyBoost API is organized around REST and developed with the PHP framework Laravel. Our API has predictable resource-oriented
                            URLs,
                            accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard
                            HTTP
                            response codes, authentication, and verbs.<br>
